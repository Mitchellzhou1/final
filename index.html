Internet addiction disorder or IAD is a broad term that describes an impulse control disorder characterized by
        spending excessive amounts of time on  the internet in chat rooms, on dating sites, scrolling through social media,
        playing online games, watching YouTube videos, etc. Also called Problematic Internet Use (PIU), internet addiction
        is characterized by hard to control, excessive use of, preoccupation with, or difficult to withstand urges to use
        one's computer, smartphone, and internet.
        It is also characterized by the experience of withdrawal symptoms when
        the user loses access to online activities. The behavior continues despite impairment and negative consequences.
        Problematic use of the internet comes in many forms, from excessive internet gaming to computer use that facilitates
        pathological gambling. Regardless of what addictive behavior is being sought out and performed online—shopping, gambling,
        gaming, etc.—all internet addictions involve excessive internet use that interferes with a person's well-being. <br> <br>
        There are currently many debates in psychiatry about internet addiction disorder and what addictive behaviors
        constitute actual addiction. That being said, gaming disorder (i.e. online gaming addiction or video game addiction)
        was included in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as an addictive
        diagnosis. Behavioral addictions like IAD share many similarities with substance use disorders, because they can impact
        dopamine levels and other hormones. Excessive and problematic internet usage can also negatively impact one's family life,
        work responsibilities, and health just as alcohol abuse and other substance abuse disorders can.</p>

      <h1>Internet Addiction Symptoms</h1>
        <p>Internet addiction manifests through various symptoms, impacting an individual's physical,
          psychological, and social well-being. Excessive time spent online often leads to physical
          manifestations such as eyestrain, headaches, and disrupted sleep patterns. Psychologically,
          individuals may exhibit signs of irritability, anxiety, or depression when unable to access the
          internet. Socially, addiction to online activities can result in neglecting real-life relationships,
          withdrawal from social interactions, and decreased performance at work or school. These symptoms
          collectively signify the adverse effects of compulsive internet usage, highlighting the need for
          moderation and mindful online habits.<br><br><br>
